# zmk-config-jorne

This is the fork of the official Jorne config for the ZMK keymap editor.
The only thing that's changed is the keymap - aimed towards iPad art software atm.

WIP:
* Procreate

TODO:
* Paintstorm (iPadOS)
* CSP (iPadOS)
* Photoshop (Windows)
* Make Layer 0 into layer_switch to simplify layer management and introduce layout selection and device choice at powering on.

# Also
My setup currently involves only the left half of the Nijuni keyboard.
This is because I used to use the Razer Nostromo, so this fork aims to transfer the experience of that setup to any OS, wirelessly.
I also plan on trying a Dumbpad in the future. Maybe I will try other ZMK projects but with encoders included by design.
I'll try to organize layouts as best as I can, suggestions are welcome.
Fork to make changes and build your own.
